<p align="center">First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head<br><br>
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh<br><br>
The way that things have been, oh-ooh<br><br>
Second thing second<br><br>
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be<br><br>
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh<br><br>
The master of my sea, oh-ooh<br><br>
I was broken from a young age<br><br>
Taking my sulking to the masses<br><br>
Writing my poems for the few<br><br>
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br><br>
Singing from heartache from the pain<br><br>
Taking my message from the veins<br><br>
Speaking my lesson from the brain<br><br>
Seeing the beauty through the...<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br><br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br><br>
First things first<br><br>
Can you imagine what's about to happen?<br><br>
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons<br><br>
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'<br><br>
This is what's happenin'<br><br>
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate<br><br>
Sound about accurate<br><br>
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy<br><br>
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities<br><br>
I know the passages come with some traffic<br><br>
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic<br><br>
And third thing third<br><br>
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count<br><br>
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh<br><br>
Is you a believer?<br><br>
I get a unicorn out of a zebra<br><br>
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo<br><br>
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather<br><br>
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader<br><br>
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain<br><br>
I know the losin' don't come without shame<br><br>
I know the beauty don't come without hurt<br><br>
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last<br><br>
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne<br><br>
I know that losin' don't come without game<br><br>
I know that glory don't come without...<br><br>
Don't come without...<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<br><br>
Pain<br><br>
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br><br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br><br>
Last things last<br><br>
By the grace of fire and flames<br><br>
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br><br>
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br><br>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br><br>
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down<br><br>
It rained down, like...<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<br><br>
Pain<br><br>
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br><br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br><br>
Pain!<br><br>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>
